We focus on a family of coloured Gaussian graphical models specifically suited for the paired data problem. Commonly, graphical models are ordered by the submodel relationship so that the search space is a lattice, called the model inclusion lattice. We introduce a novel order between models, named the twin order. We show that, embedded with this order, the model space is a lattice that, unlike the model inclusion lattice, is distributive. Furthermore, we provide the relevant rules for the computation of the neighbours of a model. The latter are more efficient than the same operations in the model inclusion lattice, and are then exploited to achieve a more efficient exploration of the search space. These results can be applied to improve the efficiency of both greedy and Bayesian model search procedures. Here we implement a stepwise backward elimination procedure and evaluate its performance by means of simulations. Finally, the procedure is applied to learn a brain network from fMRI data where the two groups correspond to the left and right hemispheres, respectively.","tags":null,"title":"Exploration of the search space of Gaussian graphical models for paired data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["TrungTin Nguyen","Dung Ngoc Nguyen","Hien Duy Nguyen","Faicel Chamroukhi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1676073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676073600,"objectID":"3b7e91a528fd62b8a6f1b2498dd699ad","permalink":"/publication/nguyen-non-asymptotic-2023/","publishdate":"2023-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nguyen-non-asymptotic-2023/","section":"publication","summary":"Mixture of experts (MoE) models are among the most popular and interesting combination techniques, with great potential for improving the performance of machine learning and statistical learning systems. We are the first to consider a polynomial softmax-gated block-diagonal mixture of experts (PSGaBloME) model for the identification of potentially nonlinear regression relationships for complex and high-dimensional heterogeneous data, where the number of explanatory and response variables can be much larger than the sample size and possibly hidden graph-structured interactions exist. These PSGaBloME models are characterized by several hyperparameters, including the number of mixture components, the complexity of softmax gating networks and Gaussian mean experts, and the hidden block-diagonal structures of covariance matrices. We contribute a nonasymptotic theory for model selection of such complex hyperparameters with the help of the slope heuristic approach in a penalized maximum likelihood estimation (PMLE) framework. In particular, we establish a non-asymptotic risk bound on the PMLE, which takes the form of an oracle inequality, given lower bound assumptions on the penalty function. Furthermore, we propose two Lasso–MLE–rank procedures, based on a new generalized expectation–maximization algorithm, to tackle the estimation problem of the collection of PSGaBloME models.","tags":null,"title":"A non-asymptotic theory for model selection in high-dimensional mixture of experts via joint rank and variable selection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dung Ngoc Nguyen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670922000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670922000,"objectID":"c6a89fef63bba04ce8355d3a68067856","permalink":"/talk/icsds2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-24T10:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/icsds2022/","section":"talk","summary":"We consider the problem of learning a graphical model when the observations come from two groups sharing the same variables but, unlike the usual approach to the joint learning of graphical models, the two groups do not correspond to different populations and therefore produce dependent samples.

This problem can be seen as a special case of a colored graphical model in which the model space forms a lattice structure.
